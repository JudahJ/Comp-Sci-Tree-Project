# Comp-Sci-Tree-Project
Implementing a Tree Structure in C

This project makes an Organizational Chart using a Tree structure in C programming. Each person is a part of the tree, where workers (children) are connected to their boss (parent). The program lets you add bosses and workers, and it can show the organizationâ€™s structure.

Features:
- Create People: You can make individual persons with their names.
- Add Workers: You can add workers under their boss.
- Show Organizational Chart: It displays the whole chart in a clear way, showing different levels with spaces.
